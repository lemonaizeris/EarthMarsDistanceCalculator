# EarthMarsDistanceCalculator

A program to simulate Solar System's planets' orbits for the upcoming 10 years.

The years are going to be increased to a much higher numbers. To do that, need to find appropriate SPICE files
that have Mars information far enough into the future (More than 10 years).

Currently, it simulates inner planets' orbits and calculates distances between Earth and Mars.

In the future it will check when the planets are visible on the northern Earth's hemisphere.
